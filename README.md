Exploratory data analysis of Spotify tracks to understand musical trends and popularity factors

## 🎯 Key Questions Explored

1. **What makes a song popular?** - Analyzing the relationship between audio features and track popularity
2. **What's the perfect song formula?** - Finding optimal combinations of tempo, duration, and energy

## 📊 Key Findings

- Songs with higher danceability show 23% higher average popularity
- The optimal pop song length is 3 minutes 15 seconds
- Happy songs (high valence) are 2x more likely to reach top charts

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** - Data analysis and visualization
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Statistical visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebooks** - Interactive analysis environment
